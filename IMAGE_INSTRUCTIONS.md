# Adding an SEO-related Background Image

To complete the hero section with a proper SEO-related image, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Use a Royalty-Free Stock Image

1. Download an SEO-related image from one of these stock photo websites:
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/seo-analytics-dashboard)
   - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/seo/)
   - [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/seo/)

2. Look for images showing:
   - SEO dashboards with graphs and charts
   - Search analytics visualizations
   - Website ranking metrics
   - Digital marketing workspaces
   - Data analysis screens

3. Save the downloaded image as `seo-background.jpg` in the `/public/images/` directory

## Option 2: Create a Custom Image

If you need a custom image that better represents your SEO tools:

1. Take a screenshot of your actual SEO dashboard (if available)
2. Create a mockup using design tools like Photoshop, Figma, or Canva
3. Save the image as `seo-background.jpg` in the `/public/images/` directory

## Image Recommendations

For best results:
- Choose a high-resolution image (at least 1920x1080px)
- Select an image with a darker color scheme so text overlaid on it is readable
- Look for images with blue/teal tones to match the current color scheme
- Avoid images with too much visual noise that could distract from your content

## Example Images

Good candidates would be:
- Analytics dashboards with graphs showing website performance
- SEO keyword research tools interface
- Heat maps or other visualization tools
- Search engine result pages with ranking indicators

Once you've added the image to the `/public/images/` directory, the hero section will automatically display it with the overlay we've added to ensure text readability.
